## Mage

## Let's get started

To replicate this project:

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp.git mage-zoomcamp
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd mage-data-engineering-zoomcamp
```

Rename `dev.env` to simply `.env`— this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it _will_ contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to http://localhost:6789 in your browser! Voila! You're ready to get started with the course. 

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `magic-zoomcamp`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.
